Today servers have been updated with a special event: The hunt for withers, who have invaded the bitquest and dogequest spawn cities. The server will reward with 100 bits to anyone who can save the city from this vicious monsters.

To help the Wither hunters, their location will be revealed in our <a href="https://discord.gg/jvJ624c">Discord server</a>, so be sure to be there.

The rules of the event are simple:

* A wither will appear only when the loot facuet is > 400 Bits/DOGE. A discord bot will send the location once.
* The player who can fight and deliver the final blow to the wither will be awarded 100 Bits.
* 100% of BTC paid to villager shops and land purchases go to the loot faucet!!

In addition to the location of the monsters, our discord bot will announce the challenge winners and other stats about the game.

As always, thanks for playing!
