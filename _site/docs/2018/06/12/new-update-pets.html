<p>Hello Bitquest community!</p>

<p>We are happy to announce a new beta update: PETS!</p>

<p>For 100 bits you can adopt a fluffy furry bestial friend: an ocelot.  It might follow you around chunks and spawns with you every time you die lol.</p>

<p>If you want to own a kitty, use the command</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">
/pet &lt;nameofyourpet&gt;
</code></p>

<p>It works in both servers: <strong>play.bitquest.co</strong> and <strong>doge.bitquest.co</strong></p>

<p>Anyway, this is a beta feature and is not finished yet, so expect your new friend to be a little glitchy.</p>

<p><strong>If you adopt more than one kitty, the last one will be yours. The others will be released to freedom!</strong></p>

<p>We want to improve this feature in the next versions with ideas from the community. Please share your ideas through our channels ;D</p>

<p>Thank you for playing!
